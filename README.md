# Mobile-Price_Range_Prediction
The objective of the project on predicting the price range of mobile devices based on their features and specifications is to develop trustworthy prediction models using machine learning techniques. This process includes data collection, preprocessing, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter adjustment, and model selection. The project's ultimate goal is to offer insightful analyses and projections that can help with informed pricing and marketing choices in the fiercely competitive mobile device market.

To start the project, crucial information about mobile devices is acquired, including brand, model, display size, camera specifications, CPU, storage, RAM, battery capacity, user reviews, and other relevant details. In order to handle missing values, feature engineering, and data standardization, this data is then preprocessed.
Multiple machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM), are then trained and assessed using the preprocessed data. The evaluation metrics applied to these models include cross-validation, precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.

By figuring out the ideal values for hyperparameters like learning rate, regularization strength, maximum tree depth, number of neighbors in KNN, and kernel type in SVM, hyperparameter tuning techniques can also be utilized to enhance model performance.

A common machine learning classification challenge, the mobile price range prediction issue aims to estimate the price range of mobile devices based on specific attributes. Using a labeled dataset of mobile device attributes and corresponding price ranges, multiple machine learning classification models were trained and assessed for this research.

Multiple classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were trained and tested after the data were analyzed, feature engineering was done, and the dataset was divided into training and testing sets. The models' performance was evaluated using performance evaluation criteria like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Using a labeled dataset of mobile device attributes, the mobile pricing range prediction project includes the creation and assessment of machine learning classification models. In order to achieve good performance, the project demonstrated the value of feature engineering, hyperparameter adjustment, and model validation. Businesses, producers of mobile devices, and retailers can use the project's findings to forecast and optimize mobile prices, provide competitive pricing, and make strategic business decisions. To improve the predictive accuracy of the models and offer more beneficial insights for the mobile device sector, additional study and experimentation with various models, feature engineering methods, and hyperparameter tuning strategies could be investigated.
